
📘 Day 5 – Workshop Summary (Final Day)

The fifth and final day of the drone workshop focused on advanced sensing technologies, mapping workflows, and practical demonstrations, followed by an assessment and certification.

🌅 Morning Session – Sensors & Mapping Concepts

In the morning session, we learned about electromagnetic radiation and its importance in drone-based sensing and imaging. We studied how different wavelengths are used in various sensing applications.

We also explored different types of sensors used in drones, including:

Image Sensors – used for capturing visual data and aerial photography

RGB Sensors – for standard color imaging and mapping

Hyperspectral Sensors – for capturing data across multiple spectral bands, used in agriculture and research

Thermal Sensors – for detecting heat signatures, useful in surveillance and rescue operations

Radar Sensors – used for distance measurement, terrain mapping, and object detection


Further, we learned about the drone mapping workflow, which includes:

1. Flight planning


2. Data acquisition


3. Image processing


4. Map generation and analysis



Simulation of mapping processes was also demonstrated to help us understand real-world implementation.

🌇 Afternoon Session – Practical Drone Show & Evaluation

In the afternoon session:

Each team was assigned one drone

We performed a drone show demonstration, where students operated drones practically and showcased coordinated flying skills

This session helped us gain hands-on confidence in flying and controlling drones


After the practical session:

An assessment test was conducted by IIITDM to evaluate our understanding of the workshop topics

Based on the performance, certifications were issued




With the successful completion of the final day:

We gained both theoretical knowledge and practical skills

We understood drone technology, components, aerodynamics, calibration, mapping, and applications

The workshop ended with a certification, marking the successful completion of the program
