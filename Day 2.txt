📅 Session Overview

The second day of the drone workshop focused on understanding the history, components, classifications, assembly, and testing of drones. The session included both theoretical learning and hands-on practical work.


🟢 1. Introduction and History of Drones

The session began with an overview of the origin and evolution of drones (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles – UAVs).

Early UAVs were mainly used for military surveillance and target practice

Over time, drones evolved with advancements in electronics, communication systems, and control mechanisms

Today, drones are widely used in:

Agriculture

Defence

Healthcare delivery

Photography and media

Mapping and surveying





🟡 2. Components of a Drone

We studied the major components required to build a drone:

Flight Controller (FC) – the brain of the drone

Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) – controls motor speed

BLDC Motors – provide thrust

Propellers – generate lift

Power Distribution Board (PDB) – distributes electrical power

Li-Po Battery – power source

Transmitter & Receiver – communication between pilot and drone

Sensors – gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS, etc.



🟠 3. Classification of Drones Based on Rotors

Drones were classified according to the number and arrangement of rotors:

Tricopter – 3 rotors

Quadcopter – 4 rotors (most common)

Hexacopter – 6 rotors

Octocopter – 8 rotors


Each configuration differs in terms of stability, payload capacity, and power consumption.




🔵 4. Types of Flight Controllers (FCs)

We learned about different types of flight controller boards, which manage the drone’s stability and movement.

Examples include:

Basic controller boards

Advanced controllers with GPS and autonomous capabilities


The FC performs:

Stabilization

Sensor data processing

Motor control signals



🟣 5. Drone System Functions

The drone system was explained using four key functions:

🔹 Perception

Collecting data using sensors like gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS


🔹 Connection

Electrical connections between components such as ESC, motors, and battery


🔹 Communication

Signal transmission between transmitter and receiver


🔹 Control

Decision-making handled by the flight controller





🛠️ 6. Drone Assembly Procedure

The step-by-step assembly process was demonstrated and performed:

1. Mounting the frame


2. Fixing the BLDC motors


3. Connecting ESCs to motors


4. Wiring ESCs to the Power Distribution Board


5. Installing the flight controller


6. Connecting receiver and battery


7. Fixing propellers (after testing)



Safety precautions were followed during assembly.



🧪 7. Motor Testing and Troubleshooting (Afternoon Session)

In the practical session:

All motors were tested after assembly

Motor rotation direction was checked (CW/CCW)

Issues identified included:

Faulty ESCs

Loose wiring

Improper connections



🔧 Actions Taken:

Errors were rectified

Non-working ESCs were identified and replaced/sorted

Final setup ensured proper functioning of all motors





📝 Conclusion

The second day of the workshop provided a comprehensive understanding of drone components, classification, and assembly procedures. The hands-on testing session helped in gaining practical exposure to troubleshooting and system integration, which is essential for building and operating drones successfully.
