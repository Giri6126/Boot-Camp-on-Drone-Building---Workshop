✈️ Drone Workshop – Day 1 Notes (Morning Session)
🟢 1. Introduction to Drones

A drone is also known as:

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)

Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)

A drone is an aircraft that flies without a human physically present inside it and is instead controlled remotely by a pilot or through automated systems.

Key Authority:

Air Traffic Control (ATC) manages airspace and provides permissions for safe drone operation.

🟡 2. Regulations for Drones in India

Drone operations in India are regulated by the
👉 Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)

🪪 Remote Pilot License (RPL) Requirements

To legally operate most drones:

Age must be between 18 and 65 years

Must have passed at least 10th standard

Must complete Authorized Remote Pilot Training

License issued by DGCA

👉 Exception:
For research and development (R&D) activities in educational institutions, license is not required.

🟠 3. Drone Registration

All drones must be registered on the DGCA portal:

🔗 https://digitalsky.dgca.gov.in/

Registration depends on:

Drone type

Drone purpose

Each drone receives a Unique Identification Number (UIN).

🔵 4. Classification of Drones (by Weight)
Category	Weight Range
Nano Drone	Less than 250 g
Micro Drone	250 g – 2 kg
Small Drone	2 kg – 25 kg
Medium Drone	25 kg – 150 kg
Large Drone	Above 150 kg

🟣 5. Drone Flying Zones

Drone flying is restricted based on distance from sensitive areas.

🔴 Red Zone

No drone flying allowed

🟡 Yellow Zone

Requires permission from ATC

Two types:

Inner Yellow Zone – within 5 km from red zone

Outer Yellow Zone – within 8 km, flight allowed up to 200 ft

🟢 Green Zone

Beyond 12 km from red zone

Can fly up to 400 ft without permission

🟤 6. Applications of Drones

Drones are widely used in many fields:

🚆 Public & Government Use

Railway security surveillance

SVAMITA scheme for mapping rural lands

🏥 Medical Field

Used by ICMR for medicine delivery to remote areas

🏏 Media & Sports

Used by BCCI for aerial broadcasting of matches

🛡️ Defence Systems

Developed by
👉 Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)

Examples:

Lakshya

Nishant

Rustom – Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) drone

🔶 7. General Drone Rules

Each drone must have a Unique Identification Number (UIN)

Violations can lead to penalties up to ₹1,00,000

Must follow DGCA airspace guidelines

(Note: Some of your original points like “no restriction for foreign drones” or “no import clearance” are not fully accurate under current DGCA policy — better to avoid or verify before writing in record.)

Afternoon Session:


🔹 Components of a Drone

We learned about the major parts of a quadcopter drone:

Frame
The structural body of the drone - Holds all components together
Motors (Brushless DC Motors) - Responsible for propeller rotation
Usually 4 motors in a quadcopter
Propellers - Create lift and thrust
Two clockwise (CW) and two counterclockwise (CCW)
Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)
Controls motor speed
Receives signals from the flight controller
Flight Controller (FC)
The brain of the drone
Stabilizes and controls the drone using sensors
Battery (Li-Po Battery)
Power source for the drone
Power Distribution Board (PDB)
Distributes power from battery to all components
Transmitter & Receiver
Used for remote control of the drone

🔹 Assembly Process Learned

We performed step-by-step assembly of a drone:

Fixing the frame base and arms

Mounting the motors on each arm

Connecting ESCs to motors

Fixing the flight controller on the frame

Wiring the power distribution system

Connecting receiver to flight controller

Attaching propellers (after checking motor direction)

We also learned the importance of:

Correct polarity in wiring

Proper tightening of screws

Weight balance

🔹 Disassembly Process

We were also trained to carefully disassemble the drone:

Removing propellers safely

Disconnecting battery and power lines

Detaching ESCs and motors

Separating frame components

This helped us understand how each part is connected internally.

🔹 Key Concepts Learned

Structure of a quadcopter drone

Working of brushless motors

Importance of ESC and flight controller

Safe handling of Li-Po batteries

Basics of wiring and connections

🔹 Safety Measures

Never connect battery while assembling

Handle propellers carefully

Avoid short circuits

Always check connections before powering

🔹 Conclusion

Day 1 provided a strong foundation in drone hardware. By learning assembly and disassembly, we gained practical knowledge of drone structure and component integration, which will help in building and troubleshooting drones in the coming days.
